                    <p><b>COMPSA 21/22: My HR gateway</b><p>
                    <indent>I had no idea what COMPSA was, or what an internal affairs director did, and I applied because the student government role I had in high school was similar to the position. My executives' leap of faith turned me into the leader, organizer, and even enabler that I am today.<br><br>
                    Since then, I've been involved in the organization as not only a director, but also an executive and volunteer. This organization has defined my sense of community within Queen's Computing that I doubt I would have received anywhere else.</indent>
